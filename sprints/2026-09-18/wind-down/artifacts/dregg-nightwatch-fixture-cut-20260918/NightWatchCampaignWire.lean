# NightWatchCampaignWire — the canonical JSON boundary that makes one watch playable

`NightWatchCampaign` is a complete judged kernel with no way in.  It has zero
`@[export]` and no wire codec, so no browser, node, or curator can reach it.  This
module is that boundary and nothing else: it is a JSON **codec**, not a constraint
system — no AIR, no gadget, no `air_accepts` lives here.

## ⚑ WHAT CHANGED 2026-08-05 — the config no longer arrives in the caller's bytes

`InputWire` used to carry `config`, so `dregg_poa_night_watch_campaign_judge` was a
pure function of the bytes it was handed: `activate?` checked that a config was
*structurally* valid and nothing checked that it was *authentic*.  A caller supplying
all-zero `riskThreshold`s and maximal `successContribution`s got a judged, internally
consistent, entirely fraudulent watch — and every theorem in this file still held,
because each one was conditional on the config supplied.

`InputWire` now carries a **world identity and an activated manifest**, and the config
is whatever `NightWatchCampaignAdmission.authorizeCampaignConfigForWorld?` finds under
`poa.night-watch-campaign.config.v1` inside a manifest whose SHA-256 root IS that
world's `contentRoot`.  There is no other route: `resolve?` cannot reach a `Config`
except through the witness, and the config codec itself lives in the admission module,
which this file imports rather than mirrors.

It also carries the node's **run activation** (slot, secret, published commitment,
player key, mission context, run seed) and the kernel re-derives the commitment and
the seed from the secret before anything is judged.  That is
`Judged.admissionChecks`'s discipline for this organ.

⚠ **The secret crosses this wire**, exactly as it does on `POA-SLOT-DERIVE-1`
(`SlotDeriveRuntime.lean:63`).  These bytes are node-held state, never a client claim,
and they must not leave the node.  The reply does not echo them — the published view
carries no activation field at all.

⚑ **The export is MOUNTED NOWHERE.**  There is still no route, no C shim, no
`build.rs` gate and no Rust binding for `dregg_poa_night_watch_campaign_judge`.  What
changed is only that mounting it would no longer hand a player the rulebook: the
authority a host must supply is an audited world, not a trusted config.

## The asymmetry, stated plainly

`NightWatchCampaign.State` is `private mk ::`.  Canonical JSON therefore **cannot
construct a state**, and this file deliberately does not try: there is no state
parser, and `StateViewWire` is encode-only.  A state is reached the one legitimate way
— `initialState` on an admitted `Activation`, then `replay` over the player's own
command log.  The host persists the COMMAND LIST, not the state.

`no_state_view_decoder_can_be_sound` proves that absence is not merely a convention:
the published view is provably NOT injective on states, so no function `StateViewWire
→ Option State` can round-trip.  The witness is two states differing only in which
nullifier they consumed.

## Fail-closed

Every decoder runs through `canonicalDecode`: parse, re-encode, and refuse unless the
bytes are byte-identical.  One JSON value therefore has exactly one accepted spelling
— key order, whitespace, decimal spelling, digest case, and unknown fields are all
fixed, not normalised.  `exactKeys` refuses missing and unknown fields; every natural
carries the kernel's own bound at the parser; unknown station, task, role and action
tags refuse.

## Two things about the kernel a reader should know

* `configValidB` does **not** require `raw.logStream.validB`.  It constrains only
  `logStream.aggregate.namespaceId = progression.federationId`; the stream's `world` is
  otherwise unchecked, so an activated `Config` may name a zero world identity.  This
  wire does not add that check — semantic validity is `activate?`'s job and a wire that
  refuses more than the kernel is a second disagreeing shape.  It is named here so it
  is findable.  (The world an admitted config is BOUND to is the activation world in
  `InputWire.world`, checked against `progression`, not `logStream.world`.)
* Replay cost is quadratic, by derivation not measurement: `judge` tests
  `command.nullifier ∈ state.consumedActions` and then inserts into that `Finset
  Digest32`, both linear, so replaying `n` commands costs Θ(n²) digest comparisons.
  `MAX_COMMAND_LOG` is the structural maximum (four commands per shift × `MAX_SHIFTS`),
  not a recommended one.

/-! ## A reachable watch — the fixture the teeth bite on

The config, the manifest, the world and the node's draw are
`NightWatchCampaignAdmission`'s: one fixture shape, shared, rather than a second one
here that agrees today.  Everything below therefore runs the ACTUAL admission path.

⚑ **THE TEETH NO LONGER BITE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build root — and twenty `native_decide` pins ran at
elaboration, so any fixture regression here was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in
the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). Seventeen of
them moved: their STATEMENTS stay here as evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions (a `def`
body elaborates without running), and the EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by
`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in `NightWatchCampaignWireFixtures.lean`, rooted in
the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture
reds the guard library instead of the archive.

⚠ **Named residue, THREE construction proofs.** `NightWatchCampaign.Activation.mk` and
`State.mk` are both `private`, so `admitActivation?`/`judge` are the ONLY producers and both
return an `Option`/`Except`. There is therefore no `Activation` and no `State` this module can
build as a fail-closed fallback, and `fixtureActivation`, `fixtureStateA` and `fixtureStateB`
must take their witnesses as DATA at construction:

  * `the_authenticated_path_reaches_an_activation` → `fixtureActivation`;
  * `fixture_claim_with_nullifier_A_reaches_a_state` → `fixtureStateA` (⚠ consumed outside this
    module, by `CanonicalCodecHealthWire`, so it keeps its exact name and type);
  * `fixture_claim_with_nullifier_B_reaches_a_state` → `fixtureStateB`.

Those three stay `native_decide` HERE, and breaking the admission path therefore still reds this
module (and the archive). Everything else moved.

⚠ `state_view_erases_the_consumed_nullifier_ledger` and its corollary
`no_state_view_decoder_can_be_sound` moved to the fixtures module TOGETHER and VERBATIM —
statements and names unchanged — because the corollary's only proof is the fixture pin. -/

The first pair is the config: a fraudulent rulebook cannot be handed to the judge any
more, because the judge does not take one.  The second pair is the hazard: a caller
who does not hold the slot secret cannot produce an activation at all. -/

/-- A rules table with every threshold at zero — every watch a guaranteed success —
decodes, activates, and is a perfectly good `Config`.  It still yields NO JUDGEMENT,
because the world's content root does not commit to it.  Before this change the same
bytes in `InputWire.config` would have been judged. -/

/-- The player's own world, freshly activated around the forged manifest, does not

it audited.  What IS proved here is the narrower fact: the manifest and the world must

slot, the commitment, the mission context, the player — and holds the WRONG secret

/-! ## ⚑ The view carries no authority

Two states reached by the same command with different nullifiers are DISTINCT — their
`consumedActions` differ — and publish the SAME view.  So `ofState` is not injective,
and the corollary is unconditional: no decoder from the published view back to a
`State` can be sound.  This is why there is no `parseStateView`, and it is refutable —
put the nullifier set in the view and the first conjunct stays true while the second
goes red.

⚠ Both `state_view_erases_the_consumed_nullifier_ledger` and its corollary
`no_state_view_decoder_can_be_sound` live in `NightWatchCampaignWireFixtures.lean`, VERBATIM —
same names, same statements, same namespace, so the fully-qualified names are unchanged. The
corollary went with the pin because its ONLY proof is that pin; leaving it here would have kept
a `native_decide` in the archive's build for no gain. -/

-- The seventeen moved pins (`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`) live in
-- `NightWatchCampaignWireFixtures.lean`, rooted in `PathOfAngelsGuards` — see the fixture
-- header above.  The only `#assert_compiled` left here is the three-proof named residue.
